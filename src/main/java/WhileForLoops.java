        //looping allows for parts of code to repeat
        //repetition can be a predefined number of times
        //or a user choice amount
        //two main kinds of loops while and for
        //both are similar, but vary in syntax setup

        //while loops require a "counter" be made outside the loop
        //"counter" checked in condition
        //"counter" updated inside the loop
        //leaves when counter check is false
        //while loops are "nicer" when dealing with String "counters"
        //  this is a personal preference


        //without updating the "counter" we will end up in an
        //infinite loop as our condition check will never change
        //this way of looping we leave the amount of times up to the user
        //we will only stop when they enter the finished word
        //this is known as a SENTINEL value


        //sometimes we want to predetermine how many times we will loop
        //this can be done with a while loop, but there are most steps
        //to remember
        //create counter outside of loop
        //check counter in loop check
        //update counter inside


        //a for loop is cleaner when we have this predetermined number
        //of repetitions we want
        //all those aspects, counter, check, change happen inside the () of the for loop
        //we do not need to remember to update or create anything because it is
        //all covered by the syntax of our () sections
        //for loops have 3 sections in their header
        //init this is the int i = 0 part as it is initializing our counter, we could initialize it to any value
        //  this is only run once at the beginning of the loop and never again
        //condition check is the i < 3 each time through the loop we will make this check
        //change is the i++ this could be any update to the counter variable
        //  we want this change to eventually make the condition check false
        //  this part is executed after all the statements in the body are executed
